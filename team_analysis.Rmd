If Team A, when they win, win by 2 or more point .28 of the time. Team B, when they lose, lose by 2 or more .55 of the time. In an upcoming game,  Team A has a .54 chance of beating Team B by 1 or more points according to the sports-books. What is the probability Team A wins the game and beats Team B by more than 2 points? 

A = .54
B = .28
C = .55

(B*A)*A = P(B)=  (.28 * .54) + (0 * .46) = .1512

P(B|A) = (.28(EB) * .1512(PB)) / .54(EA) = .28

1/(decimal odds + 1)  1/(impled decimal price + 1) - for spread .5 and ml implied of .54 (1/2.00 +1) = .33 and (1/1.85 + 1) = .35


c = 1/(1.909 +1) = .34
ml = 1/(1.775 +1)=.36
.34 * .36 = .1224

fd =
1/(1.909 +1) = .34
ml = 1/(1.769 + 1)=.36
.34 * .36 = .12


Team A has a .59 chance of beating Team B. Team A wins by 3 or more points .48% of the time. Team B loses by 3 or more .12% of the time. What is the probability Team A will beat Team B by 3 or more points?


Let's define the following events:

    Event A: Team A wins the game
    Event B: Team A wins by 3 or more points
    Event C: Team B loses by 3 or more points

We want to find the probability of Event B given that Event A occurs, which we can write as:

P(B | A) = P(A | B) * P(B) / P(A)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can rearrange this formula to solve for P(B | A):

P(B | A) = P(A | B) * P(B) / P(A)

We know that:

    P(A) = 0.59 (the probability that Team A wins the game)
    P(B | A) = 0.48% = 0.48 (the probability that Team A wins by 3 or more points given that they win the game)
    P(C) = 0.12% = .12 (the probability that Team B loses by 3 or more points)

To solve for P(B), we need to use the law of total probability. We know that:

    Event B and Event C are mutually exclusive (a game can't be won by both teams by 3 or more points)
    Event B and Event A are not necessarily mutually exclusive (Team A can win by 3 or more points, or they can win by less than 3 points)

Using the law of total probability, we can find P(B) by considering all possible ways in which Team A can win the game, either by winning by 3 or more points or by winning by less than 3 points:

P(B) = P(B | A) * P(A) + P(B | ¬A) * P(¬A)

where ¬A represents the complement of Event A, which is the event that Team A loses the game.

We don't know the probability of P(B | ¬A), but we know that if Team A loses the game, then they can't win by 3 or more points. So we can assume that P(B | ¬A) = 0.

Simplifying the equation gives:

P(B) = P(B | A) * P(A)

Substituting the values we know:


P(B) = P(B | A) * P(A) + P(B | ¬A) * P(¬A)
= 0.48 * 0.59 + 0 * 0.41
= 0.2832

So the probability that Team A wins by 3 or more points is 0.2832.

And using Bayes' formula, we can calculate the probability that Team A beats Team B by 3 or more points given that they win the game:

P(B | A) = P(A | B) * P(B) / P(A)
= 0.48 * 0.2832 / 0.59
= 0.2308

Therefore, the probability that Team A beats Team B by 3 or more points given that they win the game is approximately 0.2308 or 23.08%. I apologize again for any confusion caused by my previous response.

EV = (Probability of winning * Payout on winning) + (Probability of losing * Cost of bet)

favWev = (.74 * (100 / .59)) + (.26 * -100) = 130.50
favCev = (.5 * (100 / .5)) + (.5 * -100) = 122

dogcev = (.39 * (100 / 2)) + (.61 * -100) = -61


For example, if the moneyline price for Team A winning by 1 or more points is -110 (meaning you have to bet $110 to win $100), the expected value of betting on Team B would be $22 ($110 * (82% - 68%)). If the spread price for Team A winning by 6 or more points is -120 (meaning you have to bet $120 to win $100), the expected value of betting on Team B would be $12 ($120 * (59% - 52%)). The total expected value would be the sum of these two amounts.

Sure! Let's use the probabilities given in the question to calculate the probability of Team A winning and also winning by more than 5 points.

First, let's calculate P(B|A), which is the probability of winning by more than 5 points given that Team A has won the game:

P(B|A) = 57%

Next, let's calculate P(A), which is the prior probability of Team A winning the game:

P(A) = 72% * 60% / (72% * 60% + 40% * 60%) = 72% * 60% / (43.2%) = 0.632

And finally, let's calculate P(B), which is the overall probability of winning by more than 5 points:

P(B) = P(A and B) + P(not A and B) = P(A) * P(B|A) + (1 - P(A)) * P(B|not A)

Let's assume that P(B|not A), the probability of winning by more than 5 points given that Team A has lost the game, is 0%. Then, we have:

P(B) = 0.632 * 0.57 + (1 - 0.632) * 0 = 0.361744 + 0.3680 = 0.729744

Finally, using Bayes' Theorem, we can calculate the probability of Team A winning and also winning by more than 5 points:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.57 * 0.632 / 0.729744 = 0.499328

So, based on these probabilities, the probability of Team A winning and also winning by more than 5 points is approximately 49.93%.
```

```{r}

P(A) = 0.56 (the prior probability that Team A wins the game) # historic prob
P(B | A) = 0.5 (the probability that Team A wins the game given that they win by more than 5 points)
P(B) = P(B | A) * P(A) + (1 - 0.43) * (1 - P(A)) (the prior probability of the event that Team A beats Team B by more than 5 points)

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(A | B) = 0.66 * 0.56 / (0.66 * 0.56 + (1 - 0.86) * (1 - 0.56)) = 0.622
 priorteama win% * priorh/ahistoricw% / ditto + priorteam a not cv% * team a not h/awin % = team A win/cv

So the final answer is:

The probability that Team A beats Team B by more than 5 points is 0.622, or 62.2%.
